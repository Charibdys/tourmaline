## 0.28.0

**This release contains major breaking changes. If you currently rely on Tourmaline as a framework you may not want to update.**

- Added full support for Bot API versions 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6
- **(breaking change)** Removed all annotation based handlers.
- **(breaking change)** Removed the `Handlers` namespace. All handlers now fall directly under `Tourmaline`.
- **(breaking change)** Stripped Tourmaline of all _magic_. Models no longer have a `client` instance passed to them, instead we will now rely on the `Tourmaline::Context` which is passed to all handler callbacks.

Examples have been updated.
